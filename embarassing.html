This photo was taken at somewhere last month ago I think. I'm at somehwere here recording a vid of myself for PE purposes. I'm 
recording a vid outdoor because I'm also shy to perform or dance in our house. Our house is only small so I don't have privacy 
to record a video of myself for PE. I'm shy in taking pics and recording vids. especially when I'm recording a vid of myself 
dancing for PE. Well, Im embarassed on what I'm doing here because I don't really dance so you can describe me dancing like a robot.
